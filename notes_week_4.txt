Route definition takes the following structure: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a URL.
They are extensions of the URI that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed.
Query params start with the first ? and end with the first # 
allowable characters:
    a-z, A-Z
    0-9
    / ? : @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; = - . _ ~
To add multiple parameters, an ‘&’ is added in between each.

Path parameters are part of the URL itself. To separate them from the verbs used in the URL, a colon should prefix any variable name. 
req.params will retrieve all path parameters and return them in a JavaScript object.

Headers are metadata about an HTTP request.
