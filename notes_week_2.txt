Object Oriented Programming
    use objects to model real world things

Classes (ES6)
    special functions
    classes are the blueprint of an object, a class can have many objects
    a class is a template, objects are instances of the class
    also have methods available in classes (functions)


Constructor
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class.
    enables you to provide any custom initialization 
    if you don't provide, a default constructor will be supplied

to make a new of a class, let xxxx = neaw Xxxx();


class declaration
    ex:
    class Dog {
    constructor(breed, age) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
