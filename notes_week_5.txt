Docker  - deploy applications

containerization - when sending something across a network, when it arrives, it is usable by whoever isn onw using it (straight out of the box)
    containers are:
        standard, lightweight, secure
        (ideally) portable everywhere
        Containers share the machine's OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs
        Applications are safer in containers
